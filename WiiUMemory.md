Someone's been asking me about how the Wii U works so I figured I should do a write-up for anyone else that stumbles on it.

#Write-Up Part ?

To start off with, there's two CPUs, the Starbuck, which is an ARM926EJ-S (ARMv5TEJ instruction set if you're loading it into IDA or whatever), and the Espresso, which is a 3-core PowerPC CPU that idk what it's based on, with Paired Singles like the GameCube and Wii, and a bunch of custom SPRs
