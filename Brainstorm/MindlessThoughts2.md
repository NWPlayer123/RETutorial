this week's thoughts has been about resolutions and scaling; in an ideal world you're working with 1:1 stuff, e.g. 4K (2160p) is 4 sections of 1080p (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) so you can just duplicate the pixel into 4 and it'll fit perfectly, but of course that's never realistic. For example, working with a PNG file that is scaled to 90% won't scale up or down nicely, so you have to use an algorithm to "blend" it down to that size, of which there are many different methods. I know nothing about this so I'm just spitballing but you gotta do matrix math, take a certain bit of this pixel and this pixel and average them to get you to the right dimensions/size. 


However, you run into problems cuz you have to balance sharpness (how clean it is around the edges, if the edge is solid white and then fully transparent, it'll average and blur it depending on what algorithm you use) and saturation (picking a super bright green and a darker red and averaging it might make it really muddy-looking).

Scaling up is its own separate problem, you have to take a lower-res image and run it through a matrix/algorithm to make some educated guesses on what needs to be sharp and smooth in an image, have to guess sharpness without knowing for certain, and then filter it to the selected resolution (e.g. 284x403 to 110% is 312.4x443.3 which we round down to 312x443, and then have to run the original 284x403 image through our algorithm to get a similarly-sharp and/or smooth 312x443 image which we can then display).
